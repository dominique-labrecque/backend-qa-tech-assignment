# General
The objective of this exercise is to create automated tests to validate some basic functionalities of
Discogs' artists search mechanism.
  
The search function required credential. We use the basic key/secret in this case to simplify the
process. The key/secret values are provided in the test class setup function.
  
Search endpoint documentation API:
    https://www.discogs.com/developers#page:database,header:database-search
 
 
## Test Framework
 
The test will use the Python's unit test framework
 
Python unit Test :
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html
 
## Tests Objectives
 
As per the search API specs, we want to cover the following basic tests cases.
 
- Access :
    - Successful search when authorize.
    - Check no success if credential are bad or invalid.
 
- Per page result pagination validation
    - If no limit specified, we return default number of record per pages.
    - If a specific limit is specified, the api must return the requested number of record per pages.
    - The api will return a maximun number of result per pages, even if we provide a large limit value.

# IMPORTANT

A key/secret pair will be share upon request to do the challenge.

Otherwise it's possible to get a personnal one upon registering with Discogs.
